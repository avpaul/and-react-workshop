# GLOBAL STATE WITH CONTEXT
You don't have to pass props (data) all the way down⏬ 
With the context API you can create global state.

```js
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(null);


const App = () => (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
    <Profile />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
);


const Profile = () => {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return (
        <div>
        The current theme is { theme }
        </div>
    )
}
```
