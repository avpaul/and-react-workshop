# Hook into ReactðŸ’¥
Use state and other React features in functional components 

# Why hooks?
- Learning curve
- Reuse stateful logic between components
- Complex components                                                    `const withElement = Element => () => <Element />`
- Classes are harder to understand i.e: do you know what `this` means?


# React built-in hooks
- useState()
- useEffect()
- useReducer()
- useContext()
- useRef()
- Custom hooks
